### Contributing ###
- We'll be using git for all code contributions, please learn how to use its 
essential features, especially branching and merging.
- To clone the github repo do:
`git clone https://jllouis@bitbucket.org/dllz/swe-project.git`

OPTIONAL:
    Add your github remote (if you'd like to add the project to your github as part of your code portfolio):
    `git remote add origin --add <your-other-repo-here>`
    - This way, when you push, it pushes to both repositories simultaneously,
    however, when you pull, it only pulls from the team's bitbucket repo. 
    - If you would like to pull from your own repo, you'll have to add it as another remote and  have to specify the repo and the branch when you pull:
    `git remote add <custom-name> <your-repo-link.git>`
    - To pull from other repo do:
    `git pull <custom-name> <branch>` example:
    `git pull gh master`    
     this will pull from my 'gh' repo's 'master' branch. When I do `git push` again, it will also push it to the team's bitbucket repo.
