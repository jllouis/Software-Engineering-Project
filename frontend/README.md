# How things work simplified

## Front End
We are tapping into the nodejs(express) backend through requests.
This is called REST. There are API endpoints that we can access through REACT using axios, or other methods,
to store the values on our redux store then call it all throughout our functions once need be.

### What is REDUX?
Redux allows us to store states in a global form. This then allows us to re render the application whenever this 
redux state is changed thus making any reactive changes more simpler.
Although setting it up and understanding it may be complicated, it is convenient once set up.
